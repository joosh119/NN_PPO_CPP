## NN_PPO_CPP
A C++ implementation of a neural network and Proximal Policy Optimization with no external dependencies.

NeuralNetwork.hpp contains a NeuralNetwork class, and PPO.hpp contains a PPO class. Note that PPO.hpp depends on NeuralNetwork.hpp and CircularBuffer.hpp.

You can find example usage of the NeuralNetwork class in /nn_test and example usage of the PPO class in /cartpole_test.
